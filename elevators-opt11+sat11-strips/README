train instances:

elevators-opt11-strips instances obtained from classical-domains.
manually removed action-costs.

initially, we used easy-hard split for elevators-opt11-strips. however,
it turned out FF can solve them completely, so we moved all instances from elevators-opt11-strips to train,
then used sat11 instances as test.
